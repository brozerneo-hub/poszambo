feat: Implement Store Management and Disclaimer Integration

This commit introduces the following features and fixes:

- **Store Management:**
  - Implemented CRUD operations for stores in the backend (`backend/src/stores.ts`, `backend/src/index.ts`).
  - Created `StoresPage.tsx` for frontend store management.
  - Updated `DashboardPage.tsx` for navigation to store management.
  - Added `Store` interface to frontend and backend types.
  - Introduced generic `Modal.tsx` and updated `Button.tsx` for UI consistency.

- **Disclaimer Integration:**
  - Integrated disclaimer content into `LoginPage.tsx`.

- **Product Display Fix:**
  - Clarified frontend's direct Firestore access for products.
  - Modified `scripts/seed_firestore.js` to allow seeding of deployed Firestore and re-seeding of local emulator.

- **Infrastructure:**
  - Created `firestore.rules` and `firestore.indexes.json`.
